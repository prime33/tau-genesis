## [v0.2.3-structure-preserving-recursion] - 2025-05-29

### Changed
- 🧠 `transcompiler/tau_to_tml.py`:
  - `group_phrases()` now recursively traverses and matches phrase spans across nested lists
  - Fully preserves original logical structure (`and`, `or`, `implies`)
  - Eliminates flattening that previously broke clause context
  - Honors stream cognition principle: structure is semantically meaningful

### Summary
This release upgrades the compiler to handle logic structure with **recursive integrity**, ensuring `.tau` streams can express, preserve, and transform nuanced thought without losing syntactic fidelity.

> Tau doesn’t just parse sentences. It perceives thought structure.

---

## [v0.2.1-controlled-language-init] - 2025-05-29

### Added
- `valid_thought.tml`: updated structured output from new transcompiler
- `streams/glossary/predicate_phrases.tau`: reflexive stream for phrase-to-predicate logic
- `tau_to_tml.py`: n-gram phrase grouping and longest-match preference

### Changed
- `streams/README.md`: expanded with updated stream categories and purpose
  - Added glossary, dev, and test namespaces
  - Clarified how to contribute thematic streams
  - Reframed streams as semantic nodes in TauNet’s lawful substrate

### Purpose
This version formalizes the foundation of TauNet’s **controlled semantic language**,  
bridging human-readable phrases with logic-ready predicates.  
It establishes a structure for growing the network’s cognitive vocabulary while refining the `.tml` emitter’s expressive accuracy.

> The stream is no longer passive. It speaks with meaning.

---

## [v0.2.0-test-assertions] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- 🧪 `streams/transcompiler-tests/assertions/`
  - `sample_case.tau`: minimal transcompile logic test
  - `sample_case.expected.tml`: trusted output contract
- ✅ `run_assertions.py`:
  - Executes parser with `--compile`
  - Compares `.tml` output to `.expected.tml`
  - Reports pass/fail with diff output

### Purpose
Establishes a self-validating foundation for the Tau transcompiler.  
This test system allows you to confidently refactor logic, expand syntax, and ensure semantic integrity across logic streams.

> Tau now not only compiles — it verifies its own thought.

---

## [v0.1.9-transcompile-hybrid] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- `parser.py` hybrid logic for transcompilation:
  - Auto-compiles `.tml` for streams in `streams/dev/` and `streams/transcompiler-tests/`
  - Manual compilation via `--compile` flag for all other paths
  - Optional `<output_dir>` override; defaults to `.tau` file’s location
- Output `.tml` includes:
  - Clause headers
  - Normalized propositional logic
  - Flattened `and`, `or`, `not`, `implies` AST forms

### Tested
- `example_logic.tau` in `streams/dev/` → compiled to `.tml`
- `sample_case.tau` in `streams/transcompiler-tests/` → compiled to `.tml`

### Purpose
This release anchors a reflexive cycle:  
`.tau` stream ➝ Boolean AST ➝ `.tml` rule ➝ output stream  
All logic now breathes with awareness of location, intent, and coherence.

> TauNet now compiles with consent.

---

## [v0.1.8-transcompile-alpha] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- `parser.py`: Now builds Boolean Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) from `.tau` clause logic
- `tau_to_tml.py`: Emits Tau Meta-Language (TML) rules from structured ASTs
- Integrated transcompiler bridge: `.tau` clause ➝ parsed AST ➝ generated `.tml` rule

### Improved
- Stream parsing accuracy for logical keywords (`and`, `or`, `not`, `implies`)
- Clause header extraction and concept naming consistency

### Next
- Normalize logic symbols and punctuation
- Expand `or` into multiple `.tml` rules
- Formalize multi-clause compilation and test suite in `transcompiler-tests/`

> This release enables the first complete logic stream to code transformation pipeline in Tau Genesis.

## v0.1.7-mystic-integration – Mystic Integration of Nimrod & Babel (Latest May 25, 2025)
- **Added**: `tower_of_babel/nimrod_and_babel.md` philosophical narrative linking the Nimrod & Tower of Babel myth to Tau’s semantic coherence, AI ethics, and metaphysics.
- **Added**: Babel anti-pattern principle as `amendments/003_babel_antipattern.tau` (extends constitution with rule against semantic fragmentation).
- **Added**: Universal semantic glossary (`tree_of_life/golden_glossary.md`) defining core terms for the “golden language” framework.
- **Added**: Cautionary patterns documentation (`tower_of_babel/babel_patterns.md`) detailing known failure modes (Babel scenarios) Tau should avoid.
- **Updated**: Repository structure (new **tree_of_life** and **tower_of_babel** dirs) and README to reinforce Tree-of-Life vs. Tower-of-Babel metaphors.
- **Version**: Bumped version to v0.1.7-mystic-integration.

## v0.1.4 - Thematic Stream Expansion - May 20, 2025
TauNet expands from civic coordination into open thematic participation.

✅ What’s New
streams/README.md: contributor guide for creating new logic domains (e.g. education, energy, climate)
Promotes agent-declared streams with jurisdictional alignment and endorsement
Models how governance evolves through thematic logic — not representatives
👥 Invite
Declare your identity. Propose your domain.
Stream your policy. Emerge through law.
